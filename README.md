## Quick start

### Installing the application on your machine

Once versions of the software have been made available to the public, you can find the installer packages in the releases section â€” make sure to download the latest version to stay up to date with the latest features. 

See the official wiki for FAQ and technical information.

### Compiling the source code

See the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for more information.

If you do not have Git installed and set up on your local machine, you can download a ZIP archive of the repository under the <kbd><> Code</kbd> dropdown menu. To compile the source code, run Visual Studio 2022 (or later versions) and open the uncompressed folder, then compile the project from the IDE.

#### Clone using a Command Line Interface (CLI)

1. Create/open an empty folder on your local machine to store the project files.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory of the folder.
    - **Windows:** To do this in an efficient manner, enter the folder in the default file explorer and click on the address bar. Then, type <kbd>C</kbd> <kbd>M</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> followed by <kbd>Enter</kbd> to directly initialise a Windows terminal at the directory of your folder. This works with PowerShell in the same way. Watch the [video guide](https://youtu.be/N7IqS3PX3YA?t=80) for more.
3.  Clone this repository using the following command:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mattpieterse/UUID-Generator
```
